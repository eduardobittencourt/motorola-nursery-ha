# CI and analysis

[Documentation index](../README.md)

`.github/workflows/validate.yml` defines HACS, hassfest and the minimum/current
HA test matrix, including hash-locked dependency installation, Ruff, Bandit and
coverage. Use the workflow and requirements files for exact pins and check names.
CodeQL analyzes Python and Actions in its own workflow.

Sonar imports current-HA coverage from the same workflow run and reads the
project version from the integration manifest.
Minimum-HA tests remain mandatory compatibility checks. Analysis settings live
in `sonar-project.properties`; review settings live in `.coderabbit.yaml`.
Credentials belong in GitHub secrets and must not be exposed to untrusted PR
code. Fork PRs need a safe test path without scanner credentials.

Dependabot updates are reviewed and merged manually; no workflow enables
dependency auto-merge. These merges do not publish releases. Repository settings
are authoritative for required reviews, branch freshness and merge protection.
Resolve conflicts, failing checks and review findings before merge.

Keep analyzer findings reviewable without weakening assertions or excluding
runtime modules to improve metrics. HA callbacks must preserve their awaitable
framework contract. Protocol constants and legacy formats need contextual
review; see [security](../reference/security.md). Synthetic tests must not depend
on real accounts, email delivery, camera credentials or private captures.

Use [testing](testing.md) to reproduce checks and maintain dependency locks.
Changes to minimum HA support must keep `hacs.json`, README and matrix aligned.

Required Sonar checks are `SonarQube scan` from GitHub Actions (app ID `15368`)
and `SonarCloud Code Analysis` from the SonarQube Cloud GitHub App (app ID
`12526`). The scanner uses `sonar.qualitygate.wait=true`, so analysis failures
and rejected quality gates fail the job. The native check independently reports
the quality gate on the PR. Keep both required check names and their expected
apps aligned with the published checks. Fork PRs
run the test jobs while `SonarQube scan` and its quality gate are skipped;
scanner credentials are never provided to fork PRs.

## SonarQube Cloud setup

Use CI-based analysis with coverage and leave automatic analysis disabled.
The built-in **Sonar way** quality gate and the `previous_version` new-code
period are configured in SonarQube Cloud. CI supplies the integration manifest
version, a full Git history and coverage from the same workflow run. The
scanner's `sonar.qualitygate.wait=true` makes rejected gates fail the job.

Keep the SonarQube Cloud project bound to the correct GitHub repository and
allow the SonarQube Cloud GitHub App to access it. The native app publishes
`SonarCloud Code Analysis` and PR summaries separately from the Actions job.
The native check has been verified on PRs and is required by the merge rules.
If it stops appearing, investigate the binding and app access; a successful
scanner job alone does not prove that GitHub decoration works.

Fork PRs run tests without the Sonar token. Before merging an external
contribution that needs analysis, review it and bring the change to a branch
in this repository so the ordinary CI scanner can analyze it with coverage.
Before creating that branch, review changes to `sonar-project.properties` and
`.github/workflows/`; re-review each additional change before pushing it to the
analysis branch.
A skipped fork scan must not be treated as a successful Sonar analysis. No
privileged fork-analysis workflow is configured.

PNG files in the integration's brand directory are excluded from textual
analysis to prevent UTF-8 warnings on binary images. Runtime source and
workflow files remain in scope; existing coverage and license boundaries are
unchanged.
